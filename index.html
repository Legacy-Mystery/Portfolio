    <h2>Rights in Balance</h2>
    <p>My second website and project is on the issue of people using religion as an excuse to discriminate against the LGBT community and my projects on this subject for an English 101 class remediated and the original versions, including an informational/argumentative essay, an annotated biblography, and a grant proposal.</p>

    <p>Hello! My name is TrevorJay Andrews. I am a undergraduate student at USC Sumter, currently pursuing an associate of arts. My work focuses on the intersection of law, culture, and civil rights, driven by a commitment to ensuring that institutional support is actively affirming, not just passively tolerant, of all students. As someone who has witnessed the tensions between belief and belonging firsthand, my research aims to find concrete solutions to deeply ingrained problems in conservative regions. I am also a fiction writer specializing in fantasy, mythological, and mystery writing.</p>
