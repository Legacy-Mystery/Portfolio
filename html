    <h2>Rights in Balance</h2>
    <p>My second website and project is on the issue of people using religion as an excuse to discriminate against the LGBT community and my projects on this subject for an English 101 class remediated and the original versions, including an informational/argumentative essay, an annotated biblography, and a grant proposal.</p>
